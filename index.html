      <h2>Your Role: Ranking Areas by Water Scarcity</h2>
      <p>
        In this section, we rank urban areas based on water scarcity to help prioritize water distribution
        and optimize resource allocation. The Merge Sort algorithm has been applied to ensure an efficient
        and stable ranking system.

      <h2>Algorithm: Merge Sort</h2>
      <p>We selected the Merge Sort algorithm for its time complexity (O(n log n)) and efficiency in sorting large datasets.</p>
      <h3>Steps:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Divide the dataset into smaller subsets.</li>
        <li>Sort each subset recursively.</li>
        <li>Merge the sorted subsets to get the final sorted list.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Results and Analysis</h2>
      <p>Here are the visualizations representing the water scarcity levels in urban areas after applying Merge Sort.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The Merge Sort algorithm provides an efficient solution for ranking areas by water scarcity,
        which can assist in prioritizing resource allocation and decision-making.
